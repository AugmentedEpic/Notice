    <h1>Privacy Policy for Augment:Simplistic Website Blocker</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated: May 18, 2025</strong></p>

    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how the <strong>Augment:Simplistic Website Blocker</strong> Edge Extension collects, uses, and stores information when you use it.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect (Locally Stored):</h2>
    <p>The Extension collects and stores the following information <em><strong>locally on your device</strong></em> (within your browser's storage mechanisms):</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Blocked URLs:</strong> A list of website URLs that you choose to block using the Extension. This information is necessary for the Extension to perform its core function of redirecting blocked websites.</li>
        <li><strong>Custom Block Page Content:</strong> Any custom background images, text, or elements you add or modify on the blocked page (e.g., custom messages, design elements). This information is necessary to display your personalized blocked page.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How Information is Used:</h2>
    <p>The information collected is used <em>solely</em> for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To enable the core functionality of the Extension, such as blocking specified URLs.</li>
        <li>To display your personalized blocked page when you attempt to access a blocked URL.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage and Security:</h2>
    <p>All information mentioned above is stored <em>exclusively on your local device</em> using your browser's `localStorage` and `chrome.storage.sync` APIs.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your data on our servers or any external servers.</strong></li>
        <li>Your data remains entirely on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</li>
        <li>`chrome.storage.sync` data is synced across your signed-in Chrome/Edge browsers for your convenience, managed by Google/Microsoft respectively.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Sharing:</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data collected by this Extension with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Choices and Control:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Accessing/Modifying Data:</strong> You can view and modify the custom block page content directly within the Extension's interface when edit tools are enabled.</li>
        <li><strong>Deleting Data:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>You can clear your custom block page data and saved blocked URLs by using the "Revert to Original" button within the Extension's settings page (<code>blocked.html</code>).</li>
                <li>Uninstalling the Extension from your browser will also delete all associated local data.</li>
                <li>You can also clear your browser's local storage and synced storage data via your browser's settings, though this will affect other browser data as well.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Changes to This Privacy Policy:</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
